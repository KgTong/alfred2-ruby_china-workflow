== Arbitrary Query String Support

Arbitrary key / value pairs may be passed to Google::Search.new, all options
passed that are not assigned (deleted) will pass on to be part of the query string. 

For argument reference visit: http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_fonje_web
  
== Items

Each item type (web, image, etc) is a subclass of Google::Search::Item,
whose constant is Google::Search::Item::{Web, Image, Blog, etc}. Every aspect
of google-search is well documented, so poke around to learn more or view
spec/item_spec.rb for item attributes.

== Image example

Below we simply create a new :image search, and pass a :query string.
Query strings are urlencoded when Search#get_uri is called, so there
is no reason to do so manually.

  File.open('path/to/images.html', 'w+') do |file|
    Google::Search::Image.new(:query => 'Cookies').each do |image|
      file.write %(<img src="#{image.uri}">)
    end
  end
